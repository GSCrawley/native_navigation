# native_navigation

### this is the by_breed app with Stack Navigation; the button at the top of the screen switches between lists of cat and dog breeds. Touching a breed name brings you to the Detail screen. However, the details are not rendering and i can't figure out how to fix it.  This is the error message I'm getting:

## VirtualizedList: You have a large list that is slow to update - make sure your renderItem function renders components that follow React performance best practices like PureComponent, shouldComponentUpdate, etc. 
### Object { "contentLength": 6877.00048828125,"dt": 4514, "prevDt": 8336,
}

### I also built the same app using Tab Navigation rather than Stack Navigation, and the same thing is occuring with the Details Screen, and i'm getting the same message
